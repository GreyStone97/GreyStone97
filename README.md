## Frontend Developer (React JS)

My name is Dmitry, I am 25 years old. I have been studying programming since 2013. For some time since 2013 and up to the present time, 
I have studied different programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java and others. 

Based on the last two languages, I have created a couple of simple gaming apps. At the moment, I have completed some pet projects using different technologies.

## Educational projects
### Educational (course) project (C#) - Algorith Li
As part of studying the course "Programming and software of information technologies", I selected and formulated the topic of the course project: "Finding the shortest path in a random maze."

In the course of this work, I have studied the theoretical aspects of finding the shortest path in a maze, where not only classical algorithms for generating mazes themselves, but also algorithms for finding the shortest path are considered.
Among the algorithms considered for finding the shortest path, a wave algorithm was chosen, which is also referred to in the literature as the Lie algorithm.

It was proposed to implement this algorithm in object-oriented languages such as Python, C++, C#.
I chose the C# programming language, since in my opinion this language allowed me to implement it in a more convenient and concise form, unlike "hard" such as C++. Python was not considered due to the fact that this moment was not studied well, like C#.

More details can be found in the repository [here](https://github.com/GreyStone97/Algorith_Li).    
The coursework itself is located [here](https://cloud.mail.ru/public/pY23/NKTNW6bje).  

### Graduation project (WordPress) - Online store for the consultative and educational center "Path to health"

Within the framework of the diplom project, it was proposed to improve the work of the advisory and educational center "Path to Health", which consisted in the development of an online store on any content management system (CMS). Among the huge list of CMS systems, CMS WordPress was chosen, which has a large number of various plugins for various purposes.

## Game project using several technologies (Java & Swing & C#)
### JGames
As part of learning the Java 8 language and the Swing graphics library, I created several prototypes of well-known games, such as Minesweeper, Snake, Checkers, etc. Then, using the capabilities of Visual Studio and the C# language, previously implemented Java apps were integrated into an app written in C#, and you can also run any the app from it and which can be observed in the picture.

The project with all Java apps and the JGames app itself is located in the cloud storage: [here](https://cloud.mail.ru/public/AYXh/ADBDehBxZ)
