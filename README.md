## About me

My name is Dmitry, I am 25 years old. I have been studying programming since 2013. For some time since 2013 and up to the present time, 
I have studied different programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java and others. 

Based on the last two languages, I have created a couple of simple gaming apps. At the moment, I have completed some pet projects using different technologies.

## Educational (course) project (C#) - Algorith Li
As part of studying the course "Programming and software of information technologies", I selected and formulated the topic of the course project: "Finding the shortest path in a random maze."

In the course of this work, I have studied the theoretical aspects of finding the shortest path in a maze, where not only classical algorithms for generating mazes themselves, but also algorithms for finding the shortest path are considered.
Among the algorithms considered for finding the shortest path, a wave algorithm was chosen, which is also referred to in the literature as the Lie algorithm.

![Li_alghroritm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61186198/213748225-3e8919a5-ee82-4ad2-a85b-a4e062f7c4d6.gif)

It was proposed to implement this algorithm in object-oriented languages such as Python, C++, C#.
I chose the C# programming language, since in my opinion this language allowed me to implement it in a more convenient and concise form, unlike "hard" such as C++. Python was not considered due to the fact that this moment was not studied well, like C#.

More details can be found in the repository [here](https://github.com/GreyStone97/Algorith_Li).    
The coursework itself is located [here](https://cloud.mail.ru/public/pY23/NKTNW6bje).
